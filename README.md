Check out the original post on [gtaforums](https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002688-underground-intel) for screenshots and more.

## Requirements
- [IV-SDK .NET](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet/releases)
- [ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV/releases)

## How does it work?
- Visit your local UGS (Underground Gun Shop) to purchase intel from the dealer (default: $15,000).  
- Unlock all the pickups of the island you're on, which you can see on the radar and map.  
- This can even work with map expansions, like VCNE.
- Automatically unlock all blips or change the pricing in the .ini file.
